<p><strong>The <em>E</em>lliptic <em>C</em>urve <em>C</em>ryptography (<em>ECC</em>) used in this app is non-standard and therefore unreliable.</strong></p>

<p><em>Zilliqa</em> uses <em>Schnorr signatures</em>, which lacked Swift implementation when <em>Zhip</em> was developed. Since <em>Zhip</em> is written in Swift, it was needed to develop <em>Schnorr signatures</em> and other <em><b>ECC</b></em> methods from scratch, the result is <em><a href="https://github.com/Sajjon/EllipticCurveKit">EllipticCurveKit</a></em>. It is possible that <em>EllipticCurveKit</em> contains bugs.</p>

<p>However, <em>Zhip</em> and therefor <em>EllipticCurveKit</em> has been tested for over six months and has also gone through a brief review by <em>Zilliqa</em> team members. <b>But this does not guarantee correctness and safety.</b></p>

<p>Thus, it's recommended to send a very small amount of <em>ZILs</em> to <em>Zhip</em> when starting using it. Verify that you can send those <em>ZILs</em> back to the wallet you sent them from.</p>

<p><b>If you have any problems sending from Zhip, remember that you can <em>always</em> export your private key and/or keystore from <em>Zhip</em> and import it into any other <em>Zilliqa</em> wallet and access your funds there.</b></p>

<p>If you find any faults in the source code of either EllipticCurveKit, <em><a href="https://github.com/OpenZesame/Zesame">Zesame (Zilliqa Swift SDK)</a></em> or <em>Zhip</em>, please report issues on <em>Github</em> and/or fix the bug and submit a pull request.</p>

<p><strong>By pressing the button <em>"Accept"</em> below, you accept the risks associated with using this wallet and its unreliable <em>ECC</em> and you free all and any author who has developed <em>Zhip, Zesame, EllipticCurveKit</em> from all liability.</strong></p>
