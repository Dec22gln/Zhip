    ///   - coordinator: Child coordinator to start, either a perpertual coordinator or part of
    ///       a flow which root coordonator will finish.

    ///       child coordinator or if it should be appended.
    ///   - didStart: Optional closure in which you can pass logic to be executed when the new child coordinator
    ///       has finished presentation of its root ViewController. In most cases this is not needed.
    ///   - navigationHandler: **Required** closure in which you should handle all navigation steps emitted by
    ///       the new child coordinator.
    ///   - step: The navigation step emitted by this new child coordinator. Handled by `navigationHandler` in this parent coordinator.
