# _Zhip_ Core Contributor Expectations

We believe that our most valuable resource is the passionate community members who keep _Zhip_ running. We are always looking for active, enthusiastic members of the _Zhip_ community to become core contributors.

## How does one become a core contributor?
Contributors who have displayed lasting commitment to the evolution and maintenance of _Zhip_ will be invited to become core contributors. For instance, contributors who:
- Love to help out other users with issues on GitHub
- Continue to make _Zhip_ a stable product


## As core contributors, we:
- Review pull requests using the "Review Changes" feature in GitHub
- Merge pull requests we review, except for PRs where the author has push access. Merge PRs using the "Squash and Merge" feature in GitHub
- Respond to issues and help others
- Own regressions caused by our own contributions and PR approvals
- Maintain consistent coding standards
- Inform maintainers when critical fixes are merged so a release can be prepared
- Identify other _Zhip_ community members who would be effective core contributors
- Make _Zhip_ the best open source tool and community out there


## While doing these things, we make sure to:
- Ensure that new contributions live up to current coding standards.
- Adhere to the [_Zhip_ Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openzesame/zhip/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Keep test coverage high and ensure up-to-date documentation

## Pull Request Ownership:
We work in a high-trust environment which implies that anyone and everyone is able to merge pull requests from the community. If the PR reviewer feels strongly about seeing a PR to completion, they should assign it to themselves and request necessary changes.

## Being friendly and supportive

__Most Importantly__, our community prides itself in our supportive and friendly attitude. Above all else, we are always:

- Polite
- Friendly
- Having fun
- Encouraging the use of emojis ðŸš€
